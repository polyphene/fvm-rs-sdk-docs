Pre-requirements #Before using the SDK, clone this repository on your local machine and make sure to initialize and update the ref-fvm submodule.
git submodule init git submodule update Build an actor using the SDK #To build an actor using the SDK you can follow the example of the sdk_example_actor crate in ./examples/sdk-example-actor. Once your actor\u0026rsquo;s crate is ready just run:
cargo build Using wasm-builder in your build.rs file will compile the crate in a wasm file that can be found at the path ./examples/\u0026lt;crate-folder\u0026gt;/target/debug/wbuild/\u0026lt;crate-name\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;crate-name\u0026gt;.compact.wasm.
Test your actor #You can test your actor by either integrate it in the fvm_integration_tests crate in ref-fvm or by running your actor on a local lotus network.
Integration test framework #Create a new test in the fvm_integration_tests crate and use the path of the compiled wasm file to retrieve its binary content. You will then be able to interact with it. An example of such tests can be found in \u0026lt;ref-fvm-repository\u0026gt;/testing/integation/tests.
Lotus local network #Set up a Lotus devnet on the branch experimental/fvm-m2. Instructions can be found in the documentation. Install the actor on the lotus devnet, lotus chain install-actor \u0026lt;path-to-wasm-bytecode\u0026gt;. This command should return the CID representing the bytecode of the actor. Instantiate the actor, lotus chain create-actor \u0026lt;code-cid\u0026gt; \u0026lt;encoded-params\u0026gt;. This command should return the address at which the actor is instantiated. Invoke any function from your actor, lotus chain invoke \u0026lt;address\u0026gt; \u0026lt;method-num\u0026gt; `}),e.add({id:2,href:"/fvm-rs-sdk-docs/docs/reference/procedural-macros/",title:"Procedural Macros",description:`fvm_state #To import in your actor everything needed by the procedural macro it is recommended to use the whole state module:
