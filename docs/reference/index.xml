Limitations #
As of now some references to ref-fvm are done through cargo patches to ease the development of the SDK. This reference makes the SDK harder to use and to test through integration in a Filecoin Virtual Machine. However, the final version will be simply a line in your dependencies so please bear with us until then!</description></item><item><title>Procedural Macros</title><link>https://polyphene.github.io/fvm-rs-sdk-docs/docs/reference/procedural-macros/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 09:31:05 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://polyphene.github.io/fvm-rs-sdk-docs/docs/reference/procedural-macros/</guid><description>fvm_state #
To import in your actor everything needed by the procedural macro it is recommended to use the whole state module:
use fvm_rs_sdk::state::*; The macro should be used on a public structure. It will generate an implementation of the StateObject for the state object, allowing for it to be saved and loaded while interacting with the actor.
A simple example of usage would be:
use fvm_rs_sdk::state::*; #[fvm_state] pub struct State { pub count: u64 } Blockstore glue code is located in the SDK and can be found under the state module of the crate.</description></item></channel></rss>
